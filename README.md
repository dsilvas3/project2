Self: I did HTML mostly and helped out with whatever I could. I troubleshooted errors that the validation would say was wrong with the code. I would always make sure to communicate with my team members to meet the deadlines we had. 


Daisy: Daisy was always making sure to help us in anyway she could. We divide the project in to section such as two people work with the html and the other two work with CSS and JS then switch. Daisy worked mostly in the css and she is did a great job and always asked us for our opinion. 

Karen: She worked on the html mostly. She always helpful and would make sure to validate our code. She was always responsible and remind us when things were due.

Tenzin: Even though Tenzin was an online student she would always try to communicate with us and help in anyway she could. She aways asked us to keep her updated with what we had.She worked on many parts of the projects such as the css and js file.

Overall my team was great and responsible. I would work with them again.
